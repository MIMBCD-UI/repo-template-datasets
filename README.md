## Prerequisites

The following list is showing the required dependencies for this project to run locally:

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) or any other Git or GitHub version control tool
* [Python](https://www.python.org/) (3.5 or newer)

Here are some tutorials and documentation, if needed, to feel more comfortable about using and playing around with this repository:

* [Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html)
* [Git Tutorial](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial)
* [GitHub Quick Tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)

## Usage

### Installation

At this point, the only way to install this repository is manual. Eventually, this will be accessible through [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) or any other package manager, as mentioned on the [roadmap](#Roadmap).

Nonetheless, this kind of installation is as simple as cloning this repository. Virtually all Git and GitHub version control tools are capable of doing that. Through the console, we can use the command below, but other ways are also fine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/opprDev/repo-template-datasets.git
```

Optionally, the module/directory can be installed into the designated Python interpreter by moving it into the site-packages directory at the respective Python directory.

### Demonstration

Please, feel free to try out our demo. It is a script called `demo.py` at the src/demo directory. It can be used as follows:

```bash
python demo.py
```

Just keep in mind this is just a demo, so it does nothing more than downloading data to an arbitrary destination directory if the directory does not exist or does not have any content. Also, we did our best to make the demo as user-friendly as possible, so, above everything else, have fun! üòÅ

## Roadmap

[![CII Best Practices](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/3172/badge)](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/3172)

We need to follow the repository goal, by addressing the thereby information. Therefore, it is of chief importance to scale this solution supported by the repository. The repository solution follows the best practices, achieving the [Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII)](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en/projects/3172) specifications.

Besides that, one of our goals involves creating a configuration file to automatically test and publish our code to pip or any other package manager. It will be most likely prepared for the [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). Other goals may be written here in the future.

## Contribution

This project exists thanks to all the people who [contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md). We welcome everyone who wants to help us improve this downloader. As follows, we present some suggestions.

### Issuer

Either as something that seems missing or any need for support, just open a [new issue](https://github.com/opprDev/repo-template-datasets/issues/new). Regardless of being a simple request or a fully-structured feature, we will do our best to understand them and, eventually, solve them.
